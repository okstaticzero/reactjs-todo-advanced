# reactjs-todo-advanced
This demo is a modified todo example. It has the ability to add categories and also uses React animations. Modules are es6 based.
The app is kicked off at: src/index.js Follow the fun from there. In the next iteration I'd like to add Redux.

Working example: http://www.zerostatic.com/reactjs_todo/

The build system used here is taken from: https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack

```
//cd to directory and...
npm install
```
The followng command are available for the project"
```
# Start for development
npm start # or
npm run serve

# Start the dev-server with the dist version
npm run serve:dist

# Just build the dist version and copy static files
npm run dist

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Lint all files in src (also automatically done AFTER tests are run)
npm run lint

# Clean up the dist directory
npm run clean

# Just copy the static assets
npm run copy
```
